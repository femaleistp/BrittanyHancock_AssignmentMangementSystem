# Code Review Checklist – Assignment Management System (Lee Houk)

## 1. General Impressions

**a. What does the app do well?**  
The app runs from start to finish without crashing. The Console UI, Web API with Swagger, and test suite all launch and work as expected. The assignment model is easy to understand.

**b. Was the README helpful?**  
Yes. It gives clear steps for how to set up, run, and test the application. The architecture diagram is helpful for understanding how the parts connect.

**c. Was it easy to understand the project structure?**  
Yes. Each part of the project (Core, UI, WebAPI, and Tests) is organized in its own section. The folders inside are also neatly arranged.

## 2. Architecture and Structure

**a. Separation of concerns**  
Yes. The logic that controls how assignments work is kept in one place (`AssignmentService`), and the UI and API are used for handling input and output.

**b. Interfaces**  
Interfaces like `IAssignmentService` and `IAppLogger` are used correctly and help keep the code flexible.

**c. Suggestions for the future**  
If the app becomes more complex, you might want to split some logic into smaller helper classes (for example, checking if input is valid), but right now, it's simple and easy to follow.

**d. Folder layout**  
The folders are clearly named and well-organized, especially in the Core project with separate folders for Enums, Interfaces, and Services.

## 3. Testing

**a. Working test suite?**  
Yes. The tests all pass and cover key areas like assignment logic and API responses.

**b. Unit and integration?**  
Yes. The project has unit tests for smaller pieces and integration tests that check how things work together, including through the Web API.

**c. Descriptive test names?**  
Yes. Most test names are clear about what they're testing. A few might be long, but they are understandable.

**d. Interesting test**  
A helpful one is the test that checks if enum values are correctly passed through the API.

## 4. Documentation

**a. README completeness**  
The README explains how to run the app, what each part does, and how to run the tests. It’s complete and easy to read.

**b. Developer commentary**  
There are helpful comments in the code, and the summaries show up in the Swagger API documentation.

**c. Suggestions for improvement**  
You could add a short section to the README later that says how you would track or fix bugs if you plan to continue improving the app.

## 5. Code Quality

**a. Strengths**
- Clear and consistent names for files and methods  
- Enums are shown as readable strings in the API because of `JsonStringEnumConverter`  
- Console output is easy to read because of timestamped and color-coded logging  

**b. Enhancements**
- In your Console UI, the `UpdateAssignment()` method works well, but you could make it cleaner by splitting it into smaller methods:
  - `GetUpdateInput()` – for collecting input from the user
  - `DisplayUpdateResult()` – for showing messages to the user  

  This is not required now, but it can help keep things organized if you add more features later.

## 6. Feedback Summary

Lee, your project runs well and is thoughtfully structured. The code is clean, testing is solid, and documentation is clear. As you continue building on this project, you could try separating some of your UI logic into smaller parts to make it easier to manage. For now, you’ve done a great job creating a working, well-organized application.
