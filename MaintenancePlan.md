- Refactor any method with cyclomatic complexity > 10
- Track bugs in GitHub Issues
- Write a regression test for every bug fixed
- Maintain 80%+ test coverage
- Update `README.md` and Swagger UI when adding new features
- Remove unused code immediately after confirming via reference checks
- Keep code modular with clear separation between services, formatters, and controllers
